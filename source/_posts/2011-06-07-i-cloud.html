Earlier today Apple announced a revolutionary set of services called <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>.  I must say it sounds incredible to be able to edit a <a href="http://docs.google.com/">document</a>, sync <a href="http://mail.google.com/">contacts</a>, view my <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">calendar</a>, listen to <a href="http://music.google.com/">music</a>, read my electronic <a href="http://books.google.com/">books</a>, view my <a href="http://www.google.com/picasa">photos</a>, and access my <a href="http://mail.google.com/">email</a> from any internet enabled device. , It does seem like a great advantage to not have to upload to a cloud music service like the Amazon Cloud Player or Google Music, which iCloud offers via iTunes "scan and match" and I'm certain it will be another service I try in my attempt to find the best cloud experience.   I've been happily clouding for some time now, and hope that Apple does good things in the space.  Happy clouding.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7333770831047956364-747140899803548158?l=go-cloud-go.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
