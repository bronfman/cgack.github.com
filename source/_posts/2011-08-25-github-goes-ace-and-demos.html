A week ago <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/905-edit-like-an-ace">announced</a> they were incorporating the Ace editor (which powers the <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>).  Since I am a fan of both Cloud9 and GitHub, I gave it a whirl on my <a href="http://cgack.github.com/">GitHub Pages site</a> and was not disappointed.  As advertised one can easily open a file for editing, preview the diff of your changes and commit.  I think it will likely become useful to edit posts when (if) I finally decide to move my blog from here at Blogger to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> (just because it looks fun).  For me, this is particularly useful for simple changes like those I have made to my demos and experiments.  Speaking of demos, I had created a simple drawing app using HTML5 canvas for my preschooler which evolved into a demo of the HTML5 History API thanks to a tweet by Christian Heilmann and subsequent read of his <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/08/making-history-with-the-august-dev-derby/">blog post</a>.  I decided to use this History API to create the undo/redo functionality that I rely on heavily if i'm trying to draw something in a painting tool.  As a bonus I added a localStorage call that will recreate your last drawing if your browser closes or you are forced to leave the site for a while.  What does that look like:<br />
<br /> I entered the demo in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/devderby">DevDerby</a>, you can find it <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/html5-drawings">here</a>.  I hope you 'like' it too.  (note: I've only really tested my demo on firefox 5, 6, 7, and 8 as well as chrome 13 &amp; 14, so your results may vary if you use a different browser)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7333770831047956364-6571414986215912499?l=go-cloud-go.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
