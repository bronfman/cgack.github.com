I have been toying with the idea to move away from blogger to another blogging engine.  Since I've been doing most of my hacking via Github I have decided to move to [Octopress](http://octopress.org).  I have imported all my old posts and hopefully the conversion from HTML to .Markdown hasn't caused too much trouble.
