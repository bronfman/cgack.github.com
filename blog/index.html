  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have lately been looking to become more involed with open source projects and for starters I have been looking at jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile.  Both are amazing projects and share many of the same characteristics in their code.  This is because in both cases, the majority of the functionality is inherited from the jQuery UI widget factory.  If I&#8217;m going to become involved in this project
I should understand how this works, so the following is my breakdown of the code as I understand it.</p>

<p>The widget factory looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>$.widget = function( name, base, prototype ) {
    var namespace = name.split( "." )[ 0 ],
        fullName;
    name = name.split( "." )[ 1 ];
    fullName = namespace + "-" + name;

    if ( !prototype ) {
        prototype = base;
        base = $.Widget;
    }

    // create selector for plugin
    $.expr[ ":" ][ fullName ] = function( elem ) {
        return !!$.data( elem, name );
    };

    /* OTHER STUFF */
}
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;ll get to the stuff in a second, but lets see what we&#8217;ve already learned here. First I see that widget can take up to three arguments (name, base, prototype), and example might be something like</p>

<pre><code>$.widget("cg.awesomewidget, "ui.button", { /*...*/})
</code></pre>

<p>here name or &#8220;cg.awesomewidget&#8221; becomes the namespace and fullname so in my example I have namespaced it to &#8220;cg&#8221; with a fullname of &#8220;cg-awesomewidget&#8221;. I also see that we check if prototype is provided, if it is not we assume that we are not inheriting from a named widget, set the base parameter to prototype and set the base to the main $.Widget base object. Okay that sounds more messy than it is. Lets try to rephrase.  The base is an optional parameter telling the widget factory we want to inherit from a known widget.  In my example above its &#8220;ui.button&#8221;.  If that parameter is not provided it simply pulls from the base $.Widget. So we know that <strong>any</strong> widget will carry the prototype base of
$.Widget for starters. Now, what about this prototype?  This is the base object literal
that the widget makes its prototype.  Sweet right?  The next fun fact is that our widget gets its
very own shiny new custom selector $(&#8220;:cg-awesomewidget&#8221;).</p>

<p>Next the object is constructed via the jQuery.extend() method as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$[ namespace ] = $[ namespace ] || {};
// create the constructor using $.extend() so we can carry over any
// static properties stored on the existing constructor (if there is one)
$[ namespace ][ name ] = $.extend( function( options, element ) {
    // allow instantiation without "new" keyword
    if ( !this._createWidget ) {
        return new $[ namespace ][ name ]( options, element );
    }

    // allow instantiation without initializing for simple inheritance
    // must use "new" keyword (the code above always passes args)
    if ( arguments.length ) {
        this._createWidget( options, element );
    }
}, $[ namespace ][ name ], { version: prototype.version } );
</code></pre>

<p>here the $[ namespace ][ name ] object is merged together with the prototype.version into the
existing constructor as described in the comments.  Then the options are passed along to the
base.  Again this is done via jQuery extend.</p>

<pre><code>var basePrototype = new base();
// we need to make the options hash a property directly on the new instance
// otherwise we'll modify the options hash on the prototype that we're
// inheriting from
basePrototype.options = $.widget.extend( {}, basePrototype.options );
</code></pre>

<p>This is followed up with a call to $.each() that checks all the functions of the base and applies
those to our new widget.</p>

<pre><code>$.each( prototype, function( prop, value ) {
    if ( $.isFunction( value ) ) {
        prototype[ prop ] = (function() {
            var _super = function() {
                return base.prototype[ prop ].apply( this, arguments );
            };
            var _superApply = function( args ) {
                return base.prototype[ prop ].apply( this, args );
            };
            return function() {
                var __super = this._super,
                    __superApply = this._superApply,
                    returnValue;

                this._super = _super;
                this._superApply = _superApply;

                returnValue = value.apply( this, arguments );

                this._super = __super;
                this._superApply = __superApply;

                return returnValue;
            };
        }());
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>After all of this its time to put it all together.  The widget prototype is now set via extend where
we extend our basePrototype (widget) merging in the new widget and prototype. The last thing needed is a call to $.widget.bridge() which creates an instance of the object.</p>

<pre><code>$[ namespace ][ name ].prototype = $.widget.extend( basePrototype, {
    namespace: namespace,
    widgetName: name,
    widgetEventPrefix: name,
    widgetBaseClass: fullName
}, prototype );

$.widget.bridge( name, $[ namespace ][ name ] );
</code></pre>

<p>That concludes our walkthrough of the jQuery UI widget factory.  Fairly amazing when you look at how simple it is to create a widget based on this.  A simple example is a look at jquery.ui.tooltip.js</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was toying around with a bouncing ball on an HTML canvas the other day when I wanted to find an easy way to detect collisions. One thing that is easy is validating against the bounds of the canvas. This is done with a simple check on the bounds of the canvas as follows:</p>

<pre><code>//this is a Ball object
if (this.position.y &gt; bound.y2) {
    this.velocity.x2 = -this.velocity.x2 * drag;
    this.position.y = bound.y2;
} else if (this.position.y &lt; bound.y1) {
    this.velocity.x2 = -this.velocity.x2 * drag;
    this.position.y = bound.y1;
}
if (this.position.x &lt; bound.x1) {
    this.velocity.x1 = -this.velocity.x1 * drag;
    this.position.x = bound.x1;
} else {
    if (this.position.x &gt; bound.x2) {
        this.velocity.x1 = -this.velocity.x1 * drag;
        this.position.x = bound.x2;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You&#8217;ll see that if we get the Ball beyond the bounds of either axis we reverse the velocity vector (and for my example) I augment that vector with some drag.  Then I start the Ball off (headed the other direction now) from the start of the boundary.  This is straight forward and not too difficult to come up with.  The same can be done for other shapes on the canvas which we do not wish for the ball to pass through.  These again can be simple if we know the layout and the position of the target walls (think floating boxes).  Where this gets to a point where the shapes are not at right angles or the boundaries have become more arbitrary, I no longer want to calculate each possible collision point.  I also do not wish to wrap the object into a larger boundary box to utilize for detection.  So a more elegant solution can be found.  If we, just before moving the ball, simulate the move and have another means for detection we can then change the trajectory of the object and send it sailing away.  Here&#8217;s what we need.  we need a ball sized snapshot of the canvas where we plan to put the ball on the next move.  We then iterate through those pixels on the image and find ones that arent the color of our background (in my case non-white).  To do this without also seeing the ball as a collided upon object, I&#8217;ll clear the canvas of the ball first.  Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>//clear canvas, add shape
context.clearRect(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);

context.fillStyle = "rgb(150,150,150)"; //not white
context.beginPath();
context.moveTo(200, 100);
context.lineTo(300, 125);
context.lineTo(250, 175);
context.lineTo(200, 200);
context.lineTo(200, 100);
context.fill();
context.closePath();

//now we check our next move for collision
var imgData = context.getImageData(this.position.x + this.velocity.x1, this.position.y + this.velocity.x2, r, r);
var pix = imgData.data;
for (var i = 0; n = pix.length, i &lt; n; i += 4) {
    //check if we're not on a white pixel
    if (pix[i] != 0) { 
        this.collided = true; 
        //bounce away
        if (Math.abs(this.velocity.x1) &gt; Math.abs(this.velocity.x2)){
            this.velocity.x1 = -this.velocity.x1 * drag;
        } else {
            this.velocity.x2 = -this.velocity.x2 * drag;
        }
        break;
    } else {
        this.collided = false;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Thats it!  Now we can throw our ball at a target.  The demo I have is located at <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/cgack/mwsBY/">this jsFiddle</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Browsers are not secure.  They won’t ever be invincible to malicious attacks.  Browser A does not serve the same set of security mechanisms as Browser B.  These points are highlighted in Michal Zalewski’s book “The Tangled Web: A Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications”, but Zalewski, an expert in browser security and author of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/">Google’s Browser Security Handbook</a>, discusses in detail common and known vulnerabilities, providing hints and tips to keep web applications as secure as possible along the way.</p>

<p>The book starts with a relatively exhaustive dissection of the “Anatomy of the Web”, highlighting the history of the web, from HTTP up to Plug-ins such as Flash and Silverlight all while noting some of the varying browser implementations of many common web functionalities.  For example when discussing the Content-Disposition  Header, Zalewski notes that these headers “are truncated at NUL by Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome but not by Opera or Safari”,</p>

<p>In parts Two and Three of the book, the meat of browser security features are discussed in depth.  Highlights include a detailed look at the Same Origin Policy for all aspects of the modern web, including Scripts,  XHR, Cookies, and Plugins.  Another intriguing look into browser inner workings was the sections on special psuedo urls such as about:, javascript:, and data: and how these can lead to interesting handlings of the origination of the requests across browser implementations.  For example about:blank can be navigated to from an Existing non-same-origin page and have its origin inherited from the caller in Firefox, Webkit, and Opera while gaining a unique origin in Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Perhaps one the most valuable parts of “The Tangled Web” is how Zalewski adds a handy “Security Engineering Cheat Sheet” to the end of each chapter.   Having these quick tips at ones fingertips is a remarkable asset and great addition to the book.  I could continue to outline the great parts of this book, and tout the security expertise that jumps from the pages, but the most important parts in the book are what each reader takes away.  Whether its a small attack vector that a reader picks up on to close a vulnerability in their own web application, or an interesting fact about browser inconsistencies, each reader should gain something from this book.  For me, the take away is that as a developer there is no magic bullet and we will always uncover new security holes in our web applications, either from poor programming, or new features of a browser’s implementation.  And that our expectations should not be that we have a perfectly impenetrable web, or are capable of producing one.  Zalewski puts it like this, “As the complexity of our online interactions approaches that of real life, the odds of designing perfectly secure software are rapidly diminishing”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago I entered the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/devderby/2011/august/">August Mozilla Dev Derby</a>, which focused on the History API. I have seen some of the amazing things that the new changes to this interface have been able to make from folks like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=438532093919">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blog/760-the-tree-slider">GitHub</a> but I wanted to try something a little different. I had been hacking on a simple drawing canvas and decided that I could leverage the History API to create a more application like experience. Since winning the Derby, I&#8217;ve seen my code improved and extended in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/paint-search">later Dev Derby Entry</a>, and I turned it into a sample <a href="https://apps-preview.mozilla.org/en-US/apps/app/draw/?src=cb-dl-free">application</a> for <a href="https://apps-preview.mozilla.org/en-US/apps/">Mozilla&#8217;s new App experience</a>. Here’s a peek into the process of creating a drawing demo like the one I created.</p>

<h2>Basic Setup</h2>

<p>Firstly, we’re going to need to create a canvas.  This is pretty straightforward for those who have done this sort of thing before, but for a reminder that can look like the following</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
     &lt;div id="content"&gt;
        &lt;canvas id="canvas" height="500" width="500"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have our canvas we can start to initialize it and get ready to roll with the fun features we’d like to demonstrate.</p>

<pre><code>var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas"),
    ctx = canvas.getContext("2d"),
    img, //more about this later
    blankCanvas = true; //this too
</code></pre>

<p>We now need to set it up to allow for drawing.  This is done by adding a event listeners to the mouse events we’d like to watch.</p>

<pre><code>window.addEventListener("mousedown", setupDraw, false);
window.addEventListener("mousemove", setupDraw, false);
window.addEventListener("mouseup", setupDraw, false);
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll notice the setupDraw function is called on all of these events.  This function will grab the coordinates of our pointer (less the offset of our lovely #content div and send those to our draw object.</p>

<pre><code>function setupDraw(event) {
    var cnt = document.getElementById("content"),
        coordinates = {
            x: event.pageX - cnt.offsetLeft,
            y: event.pageY - cnt.offsetTop
          };
    draw[event.type](coordinates);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now time for the drawing I’ll go ahead and let you peek at the source so you can follow along.</p>

<pre><code>var draw = {
    isDrawing: false,
    mousedown: function(coordinates) {
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(coordinates.x, coordinates.y);
        this.isDrawing = true;
    },
    mousemove: function(coordinates) {
        if (this.isDrawing) {
            ctx.lineTo(coordinates.x, coordinates.y);
            ctx.stroke();
        }
    },
    mouseup: function(coordinates) {
        this.isDrawing = false;
        ctx.lineTo(coordinates.x, coordinates.y);
        ctx.stroke();
        ctx.closePath();
      }
};
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll see this object directs to an event type specific function and handles the coordinates parameters which are passed into the object.  Following some basic canvas drawing steps for ctx.beginPath() -> ctx.moveTo(x,y) -> ctx.lineTo(x,y) -> ctx.stroke() -> ctx.closePath() we now have the ability to draw with our mouse.  The “isDrawing” property is there to let us know to continue our strokes on mousemove.  Now that we have an example that allows us to draw, we’ll move forward to make it more interesting by utilizing the History API and LocalStorage.</p>

<h2>About the History API</h2>

<p>One of the new features in HTML5 (an subject of the Dev Derby) is the additional features of the History API.   These are history.pushState(data,title [,url]) and history.replaceState(data, title [,url] ) which are utilized to directly push (or replace) data in the session history.  For the purposes of this demo we’ll be using pushState to add data, specifically the image data from the canvas, to the current URL.  Now this alone is not enough we will also need to know when the current state changes, which is made accessible to us via the window.onpopstate event.  This event fires when the browser gets a new history event.  We can inspect the event to see if it contains a state and then load the data (hopefully our image) into the canvas.  So to get things wired up correctly, its time to add a function to store the history.</p>

<pre><code>var storeHistory = function () {
    img = canvas.toDataURL("image/png");
    history.pushState({ imageData: img }, "", window.location.href);
};
</code></pre>

<p>This grabs the data from the canvas in the form of a “data:image/png&#8230;” url.  Then we create a new history state by pushing an imageData attribute for later retrieval.  Now, before we add the calls to storeHistory to our drawing application, we need to do a bit of preventative maintenance.  If we store this data and navigate backward without a reinitialization of the canvas, we will just draw the stored imageData onto the existing image.  To us this will look like it isn’t working so we need to add an initialization function to reset our canvas.</p>

<pre><code>var initializeCvs = function () {
    ctx.lineCap = "round";
    ctx.save();
    ctx.fillStyle = '#ffffff';
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height);
    ctx.restore();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can go about the business of storing our history states.  The code that follows will store history in two places.  The first place it stores is if the canvas is blank it stores that before drawing anything.  The second is on the mouseup event after  the line is completed.  Now our draw object looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var draw = {
    isDrawing: false,
    mousedown: function(coordinates) {
        if (blankCanvas) { storeHistory(); blankCanvas = false; }
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(coordinates.x, coordinates.y);
        this.isDrawing = true;
    },
    mousemove: function(coordinates) {
        if (this.isDrawing) {
            ctx.lineTo(coordinates.x, coordinates.y);
            ctx.stroke();
        }
    },
    mouseup: function(coordinates) {
        this.isDrawing = false;
        ctx.lineTo(coordinates.x, coordinates.y);
        ctx.stroke();
        ctx.closePath();
        storeHistory();
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Awesome, now we have started storing history on the page with each completed line.  Now we need to be able to see the results of this work when the history state changes.  As I mentioned earlier this is done via the window.onpopstate event.  We will examine the imageData of the state (if it exists) and place that image on the canvas as follows:</p>

<pre><code> window.onpopstate = function (event) {
        if (event.state !== null) {
            img = new Image();
            img.onload =function () {
                ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
            };
            img.src = event.state.imageData;
        }
    };
</code></pre>

<p>Splendid, we now  have a drawing tool that stores history so we can undo and redo drawings.  But wait!  What happens if I’m in the middle of a canvas masterpiece and my browser crashes?  Lets handle that with localStorage.  With localStorage we can store a named item locally independent of our session, so in the event of leaving the page, we can retrieve data from our previous encounter.  In this demo I did a simple test of the window.localStorage object to see if we can store data, and then I store the latest image so upon return you’ll at least be able to recover that data.  Here are the initializeCanvas and storeHistory functions with this additional feature added:</p>

<pre><code>var initializeCvs = function () {
    ctx.lineCap = "round";
    ctx.save();
    ctx.fillStyle = '#ffffff';
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height);
    ctx.restore();

    if (window.localStorage) {
        img = new Image();
        img.onload = function () {
            ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been toying with the idea to move away from blogger to another blogging engine.  Since I&#8217;ve been doing most of my hacking via Github I have decided to move to <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>.  I have imported most my old posts and hopefully the conversion hasn&#8217;t caused too much trouble.  The original posts can still be found on my <a href="http://blog.cgack.com">blogger blog</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<br /></div>
I used to think that building web applications in Python for Google&#8217;s app engine was reserved for a desktop development environment. &nbsp;I had hacked a bit on an app or two and used the command line tools to test and publish to the app engine. &nbsp;Then I discovered <a href="https://coderbuddy1.appspot.com/">CoderBuddy</a>. &nbsp; CoderBuddy is a one stop shop for building python apps for the app engine. &nbsp;Once signed in you can create a blank project, or get a head start with one of six template apps. &nbsp;One template is of course a &#8220;hello world&#8221; app, but there are a &nbsp;few other samples including 3 that come with some <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> (arguably the go to MVC framework for python web applications). &nbsp; I tested a couple of the template apps and found them to be quite useful. &nbsp;The &#8220;Adrian Remembers Me&#8221; template creates an app that allows users to become members and sign in. &nbsp; Here is a look at the editor with the main.py file opened for this project:<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ES_BL0gUWTM/TqLjtn668qI/AAAAAAAAApU/-SwPW-jQsw8/s1600/cgack2-coderbuddy+-+CoderBuddy.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="256" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ES_BL0gUWTM/TqLjtn668qI/AAAAAAAAApU/-SwPW-jQsw8/s400/cgack2-coderbuddy+-+CoderBuddy.png" width="400" /></a><br />
<br />
<br />
Each of these templates could be either a good launching point or reference for a new developer looking to quickly create a Python app. &nbsp;Deploying to the App Engine is just a few clicks away with CoderBuddy. &nbsp;So I &#8220;created&#8221; my Adrian Remembers Me app in one click and about two minutes later had my site running on the app engine at&nbsp;<a href="http://cgack2-coderbuddy.appspot.com/">http://cgack2-coderbuddy.appspot.com/</a>. &nbsp;The ease of deploy along with the ability to upload files and download the project as a .zip I will definitely look to CoderBuddy for part if not all of my next project.

  <div class="entry-content">One of my favorite online IDEs has added support for Heroku.  This is great news as I have enjoyed developing node.js applications in <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9</a> but felt that the main thing it lacked was a method to deploy directly to the cloud.  So I took it for a test run.  I signed in to Cloud 9 and created a simple hello world app, make sure you use the process.env.PORT to listen on so Heroku can deploy it properly.<br /><br />Commit your changes via the Cloud 9 git interface.Then all you have to do is click the Deploy button in Cloud 9, sign in to Heroku, create your new instance, and deploy.  If you haven&#8217;t created a package.json or Procfile (needed for Heroku deploy), Cloud 9 will create those for you.

  <div class="entry-content">A week ago <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/905-edit-like-an-ace">announced</a> they were incorporating the Ace editor (which powers the <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>).  Since I am a fan of both Cloud9 and GitHub, I gave it a whirl on my <a href="http://cgack.github.com/">GitHub Pages site</a> and was not disappointed.  As advertised one can easily open a file for editing, preview the diff of your changes and commit.  I think it will likely become useful to edit posts when (if) I finally decide to move my blog from here at Blogger to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> (just because it looks fun).  For me, this is particularly useful for simple changes like those I have made to my demos and experiments.  Speaking of demos, I had created a simple drawing app using HTML5 canvas for my preschooler which evolved into a demo of the HTML5 History API thanks to a tweet by Christian Heilmann and subsequent read of his <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/08/making-history-with-the-august-dev-derby/">blog post</a>.  I decided to use this History API to create the undo/redo functionality that I rely on heavily if i&#8217;m trying to draw something in a painting tool.  As a bonus I added a localStorage call that will recreate your last drawing if your browser closes or you are forced to leave the site for a while.  What does that look like:<br />
<br /> I entered the demo in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/devderby">DevDerby</a>, you can find it <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/html5-drawings">here</a>.  I hope you &#8217;like&#8217; it too.  (note: I&#8217;ve only really tested my demo on firefox 5, 6, 7, and 8 as well as chrome 13 &amp; 14, so your results may vary if you use a different browser)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7333770831047956364-6571414986215912499?l=go-cloud-go.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time trying to find the best development method in Chrome OS.  Recently I decided I wanted to create a chrome extension using Chrome OS.  My first stop was CodeRun IDE which has a sample Chrome Extension project so I thought it would be great for a starter.  The development is pretty mess free, but the problem comes once its downloaded.  It comes downloaded and zipped.  When loading an unpackaged Chrome Extension you can point Chrome to a directory, but not a zipped directory.  So I had to unzip the files&#8230;which was pretty easy to do once I found <a href="http://wobzip.org/">wobzip</a>.<br /><br />Now that I had a skeleton Chrome Extension up and running, I could start to make it my own.  I decided on a simple calculator for starters, plus I thought it might be useful.  I have to admit it had been a while since I&#8217;d used the user &#8216;chronos&#8217; in Developer mode, but once I got it there I found that Chrome OS had a new default text editor (thankfully) in &#8216;vi&#8217;.  This is where it got really fun.  I edited my popup.html file to have a stylesheet and JavaScript file and loaded the html directly in Chrome.  Enter the best web app ever&#8230; Chrome Dev Tools.<br /><br />With Dev tools I am able to make changes to my stylesheets through the inspector to get the style just how I want, then save the modified .css file to the extension directory. <br /> Similarly, I can edit and save versions of my JavaScript file directly from Dev tools.  The only issue with this is when I overlooked some invalid code which prevented Chrome from loading the JavaScript file.  This was not much of an issue the one time it happened to me, as I was able to enter vi and quickly rectify the rogue curly brace and was back to Dev Tools in no time.  So If you ask me what my choice is for rapid JavaScript development, I&#8217;ll say Chrome Dev Tools.<br /><br /> The result from blank files to:<br /><br /><br />and <br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7333770831047956364-1069319577707889253?l=go-cloud-go.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Earlier today Apple announced a revolutionary set of services called <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>.  I must say it sounds incredible to be able to edit a <a href="http://docs.google.com/">document</a>, sync <a href="http://mail.google.com/">contacts</a>, view my <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">calendar</a>, listen to <a href="http://music.google.com/">music</a>, read my electronic <a href="http://books.google.com/">books</a>, view my <a href="http://www.google.com/picasa">photos</a>, and access my <a href="http://mail.google.com/">email</a> from any internet enabled device. , It does seem like a great advantage to not have to upload to a cloud music service like the Amazon Cloud Player or Google Music, which iCloud offers via iTunes &#8220;scan and match&#8221; and I&#8217;m certain it will be another service I try in my attempt to find the best cloud experience.   I&#8217;ve been happily clouding for some time now, and hope that Apple does good things in the space.  Happy clouding.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7333770831047956364-747140899803548158?l=go-cloud-go.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
